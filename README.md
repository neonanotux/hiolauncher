 HIO Launcher
 
 This simplified browser app is based on chromium and made in visual studio.

 I wanted a fast and easy way to play this game without using a big browser with alot of toolbars, plugins and extensions.

 This launcher will see new features and improvements over time. Enjoy hordes.io and thanks for using HIO Launcher.
 
 ---IMPORTANT!---
 
 Due to security reasons, never download HIO Launcher from another source than this.
 
### Keybinds:

F10 = delete cookies (remove account auto login)

F11 = Restart application in fullscreen borderless

F12 = Restart application in fullscreen borderless with taskbar

Other info:

When launching for the first time in this new browser app, you might have to go over your ingame settings again as this is a new launcher.

To hide the ESC button notification from showing up, hold right mouse button for 5 sec untill notification disappear. This is a chromium feature that I will be hiding in a later release.
